# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-18)

**Core value:** The rail-band and fin-placement calculators produce numbers a shaper trusts enough to cut foam to — everything else supports that.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation: Port & Deploy the Design Tool

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Foundation — Port & Deploy the Design Tool)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-08-18 - Completed quick task 260818-mr2: Rebuild Fin Setup & Placement screen (lib/geometry fins port with Vitest golden tests, fins screen with dimensioned diagram, data and model info tabs)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Existing Claude Design prototype (rail-band + fin-placement calculators) is ported into `reference/` and rebuilt as the real app in Phase 1, not rebuilt from scratch
- [Roadmap]: ROCK-01 and FOIL-01 (rocker/foil editors) deferred to Phase 4 — Phase 1's port carries the rail-band/fin-placement calculators forward; volume (Phase 3) initially computes off outline+rocker before foil becomes user-editable in Phase 4
- [Roadmap]: This roadmap covers build-guide milestones M1-M3 only; M4 (invite shapers), M5 (billing/Pro), M6 (exports/sharing/gallery) are future milestones, not in v1 requirements
