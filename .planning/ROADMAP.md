# Roadmap: Shaper

## Overview

Shaper started from a working prototype (built in Claude Design) that already proved out the two "secret sauce" calculators — rail band and fin placement — but lived outside the codebase as a single self-contained page. **Milestone v1.0 (Phases 1–4, complete 2026-08-29)** ported that prototype into a real Next.js app and got it live with accounts and saving, proved the geometry math trustworthy and extended it to volume and printable templates, then built the rocker and foil editors as first-class interactive tools. A shaper can now log in, shape a full board design (outline, rocker, rail, foil, fins), see live-calculated rail band dimensions, fin placement and volume, save it as a named model, and print a full-size template to cut foam from — all of it in inches and litres.

**Milestone v1.1 (Phases 5–7, complete 2026-09-06)** gives the shaper a choice. Every board is already stored in millimetres, so this is presentation work: a units chooser in the settings menu, one set of metric formatters and parsers beside the imperial ones in `lib/geometry/units.ts`, and then every place a number is shown — roughly 300 of them across about 25 files — reading the shaper's chosen system instead of assuming inches. It lands in three passes a shaper can see and try one at a time: the chooser itself proving out on the setup screen, then the five design screens, then everything that comes out of a printer.

**Milestone v1.2 (Phases 8–10, complete 2026-09-12)** finishes what the prototype started and takes the app off the desk. The rails screen has always been missing its third tab — the INSTRUCTIONS page that names every mark on a rail cross-section and lets a shaper flip the example between Flat and Domed — along with a 1:1 on-screen view to hold against the foam, a plan and side reference showing where each section sits on the board, and an option to fold that instructions sheet into what gets printed. None of it needs new geometry: the prototype's `halveDeckMark1` flag turned out to be dead code, so the rail-band calculator already in `lib/` draws the example rail exactly as the reference did. The second half is phone work, and it is not polish — the five design screens carry zero responsive breakpoints today, so the phone layout is built from scratch and touch-first: one shared screen shell instead of five copies of the same sidebar-and-canvas layout, drawings that fill the screen, and drag handles on the outline, rocker and foil curves sized for a thumb. It lands in three passes: rails first (the smaller, self-contained port), then the design screens on a phone (where touch drag lives), then everything around them — sign-in, presets, the rack and the summary — walked end to end on a real iPhone and a real Android phone.

- [x] **Phase 8: The Rails Screen, Finished** - The INSTRUCTIONS tab with its named example rail and Flat/Domed toggle, "View Full Sized" at 1:1, the plan and side reference view, and an option to fold the instructions sheet into what gets printed (completed 2026-09-08)
- [x] **Phase 9: The Design Screens on a Phone** - One shared screen shell stacks the five design screens for a narrow screen, with finger-sized controls and outline, rocker and foil points a thumb can drag (completed 2026-09-09)
- [x] **Phase 10: The Whole App on a Phone** - Sign-in, presets, the rack and the summary reflowed and touch-sized, with the whole trip walked end to end on real phones (completed 2026-09-12)

## Phase Details

Phases 1–4 below are the completed v1.0 record — goals, requirement IDs and completion dates. Their plan artifacts (PLAN.md, SUMMARY.md, VERIFICATION.md and the rest) are archived under `.planning/milestones/v1.0-phases/` and are not repeated here.

### Phase 1: Foundation — Port & Deploy the Design Tool

**Goal**: The ported prototype runs as a real Next.js/TypeScript/Tailwind v4/shadcn app, live on Vercel, letting a user set dimensions, shape an outline, and see rail-band and fin-placement numbers calculated from real formulas — with that math implemented as pure TypeScript functions under `lib/`, per the project's geometry constraint.
**Mode:** mvp
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: SETUP-01, OUTL-01, RAIL-01, FIN-01, FIN-02, FIN-03, VIZ-01, UNIT-01
**Plans**: 4/4 executed
**Completed**: 2026-08-21 — artifacts archived under `.planning/milestones/v1.0-phases/01-foundation-port-deploy-the-design-tool/`

### Phase 2: Accounts & Saved Designs

**Goal**: Users have their own account and their designs persist across sessions, completing the "live + saving" milestone.
**Mode:** mvp
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: ACCT-01, ACCT-02, ACCT-03, MODL-01, MODL-02, MODL-03
**Plans**: 6/6 executed
**Completed**: 2026-08-28 — artifacts archived under `.planning/milestones/v1.0-phases/02-accounts-saved-designs/`

### Phase 3: Volume, Templates & Verified Math

**Goal**: The core geometry math is proven correct by automated tests, board volume updates live as the design changes, and users can print a full-size template to cut foam from — completing the "the math is right" milestone.
**Mode:** mvp
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: VOL-01, TMPL-01
**Plans**: 7/7 executed
**Completed**: 2026-08-28 — artifacts archived under `.planning/milestones/v1.0-phases/03-volume-templates-verified-math/`

### Phase 4: Rocker & Foil Editors

**Goal**: Users can shape a rocker curve and a foil profile as first-class, interactive parts of the design, with rail band and volume recalculating live as they adjust either — completing the "shaper features" milestone's editor work.
**Mode:** mvp
**Depends on**: Phase 1, Phase 3
**Requirements**: ROCK-01, FOIL-01
**Plans**: 5/5 executed
**Completed**: 2026-08-29 — artifacts archived under `.planning/milestones/v1.0-phases/04-rocker-foil-editors/`

### Milestone v1.1: Imperial vs Metric (Phases 5–7, complete 2026-09-06)

Shipped — 21 plans across 3 phases. A shaper picks Imperial or Metric from the gear menu and every
number in the app follows: the setup screen, all five design screens, and everything that comes out
of a printer. Full phase detail archived in
[`.planning/milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md`](milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md); audit in
[`.planning/v1.1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`](v1.1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md).

---

### Milestone v1.2: Rails Finished, Phone Ready (Phases 8–10, complete 2026-09-12)

Shipped — 29 plans across 3 phases. The rails screen got the third tab the prototype always
promised (INSTRUCTIONS, Flat/Domed, View Full Sized at 1:1, a plan/side reference, the sheet folded
into the printed order form), and the whole app — sign-in, the rack, all five design screens,
saving, the summary — works in a shaper's hand on a real phone, with a desktop mouse seeing nothing
change. PHON-10 closed on a real iPhone alone; the Android walk was skipped by the founder's own
decision (D-12) and is recorded as such. Full phase detail archived in
[`.planning/milestones/v1.2-ROADMAP.md`](milestones/v1.2-ROADMAP.md); requirements in
[`.planning/milestones/v1.2-REQUIREMENTS.md`](milestones/v1.2-REQUIREMENTS.md); audit in
[`.planning/milestones/v1.2-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`](milestones/v1.2-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md); phase
artifacts in [`.planning/milestones/v1.2-phases/`](milestones/v1.2-phases/).
